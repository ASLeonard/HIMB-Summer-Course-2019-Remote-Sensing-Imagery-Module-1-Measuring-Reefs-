Can satellite imagery be used to measure reef size properties? And is it more accurate/efficient than measuring in the field?

Let's find out!

## Structure
This contains the instructions and example data analyses of the Day 1 (afternoon) & Day 2 of the Remote Sensing Imagery Module 1: Measuring Reefs of the HIMB Summer Course 2019.

#### Rotation group C

The data collected here is from rotation group C. As discussed in the report, reef 12 does not have a field measurement due to a shark reporting. The analysis can be generalised to a larger dataset, but may suffer from plot overcrowding. 

#### Report

The report can be found (here)[report.md], and contains the analysis implementation and some surrounding discussion.
